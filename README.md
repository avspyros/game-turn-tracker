A simple tool for RPG and board games.

Add an Actor (character, creature etc.) entry by typing the actor's name and the value of the dice they rolled. If their
turn does not depend on dice rolls just enter numbers representing their turn.

Use the "Next" button to highlight the current Actor's turn during the game round.

Clear all values with upper right X button.
