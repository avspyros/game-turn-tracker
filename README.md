A simple tool for RPG and Board Games.

Add an Actor (character, creature etc.) entry by typing the actor's name and the value of the dice they rolled.

If their turn does not depend on dice rolls just enter numbers representing their turn. Bigger number goes first.

Use the "Next" button to highlight the current Actor's turn during the game round. After all Actors had their turn,
counter moves to the next round.
